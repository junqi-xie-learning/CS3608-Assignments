# Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

(Source: [LeetCode 787](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/))

## Description

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [from_i, to_i, price_i]` indicates that there is a flight from city `from_i` to city `to_i` with cost `price_i`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return ***the cheapest price** from* `src` *to* `dst` *with at most* `k` *stops.* If there is no such route, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/02/16/995.png)

* **Input:** `n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1`
* **Output:** `200`
* **Explanation:** The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

### Example 2

* **Input:** `n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0`
* **Output:** `500`
* **Explanation:** The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in blue and has cost 500.

## Constraints

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `flights[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`
* `from_i != to_i`
* `1 <= price_i <= 10000`
* There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
* `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
* `src != dst`
